# 🚀 PINJOC Landing Page

## 📜 Description

PINJOC is a decentralized fixed-rate lending protocol that revolutionizes DeFi lending by implementing a market-driven interest rate mechanism. Built on the Monad Network, the protocol leverages CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) technology  to ensure efficient price discovery and optimal interest rate determination based on real-time supply and demand dynamics.

This landing page serves as the initial entry point for users visiting the web app, providing an overview of the protocol and guiding them to further interactions.
